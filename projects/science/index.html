                    <p>Reefs are the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, and coral is a perfect example of why biodiversity is necessary. The coral itself is an animal, however, it wouldn’t be what we think of without plant
                        organisms called Zooxanthellae. They work in harmony with the coral photosynthesising to provide the coral with food. These tiny organisms are what gives coral its distinctive colors. The coral then uses this food to create
                        calcium carbonate to form the beautiful structures we see on reefs. These are the structures that house tiny invertebrates which the fish feed on.</p>
                    <p>Reproduction in the reef is one of the most unique things about this ecosystem. It is believed by scientists that some small creatures are so rare that they may never meet another member of their species to
                        reproduce in their whole lifetime. This means that very few organisms could be responsible for a whole generation of their species. Coral reproduces in an utterly remarkable way. On one day of the year, all the coral of one
                        type will release packets of eggs and sperm. They will float to the surface to mix and then be taken by the tide to grow into new reefs over thousands of years.</p>
                    <p>Prey and predators live in harmony on reefs. Fish swim around aware of the threats around them, but safe in the knowledge that they could escape easily. The predators know this so they only attack when they
                        will win in order to save energy.<br><br>"<i>...the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.</i>"<br>- Richard Feynman</p>

            <p class="section-text">Humans are extremely genetically diverse compared to other species on our planet. We have been evolving over billions of years to form language and social structure, yet we can still see major genetic divides
                throughout the population of our planet.</p>
            <p class="section-text">One of the most interesting instances of this is lactose persistence. This is the ability to digest dairy products after weening. A mutation has caused the lactase enzyme to continue to be produced throughout a
                person's life. In many parts of the world, it is unusual to be able to digest dairy products. Whereas, in Western Europe, it is considered normal to be able to do so. This mutation was caused when diary became an important part of the
                diet of some cultures giving a selective evolutionary advantage to adults that could digest these foods.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Today, 0.1% of a person DNA will be different from another person's, which doesn't sound like much until you consider the fact that we have upwards of 3,000,000,000 base pairs of DNA. Humans also share much of their genes with
                the rest of the natural world, leading scientists to believe that all life came from a common ancestor. Our DNA is always being tested by scientists in order to find a function for every gene; however, some genes create no observable
                difference to an animals behaviour, but we know they are important because evolution has protected them over the millenniums. Some parts of nature remain a mystery to us all.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Whether life exists on other planets is a question that has plagued many of the greatest scientists throughout modern history, but if it does exist, how would we find it? There could be as many as 40 billion
                Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, and 11 billion orbiting sun-like stars. The nearest is 12 light-years away.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Most people, in the 21st century, agree that life is out “there” on a planet far beyond our solar system, but recent discoveries show that life could be found much closer to home. The spacecraft, Cassini,
                discovered a moon of Saturn - Enceladus - that had a subsurface saltwater ocean that might contain hydrothermal vents. Some scientists believe that life on Earth could have originated in heated vents like these on the ocean floor.
                This also shows that the oceans could be warm enough to develop life.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Each star has a theoretical band around it, know as the habitable zone, in which, a planet would be able to form, and it would be the correct temperature for water to pool. A planet would also need low amounts of
                radiation, low-temperature variation, and high amounts of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen to allow life to grow. Although, not every star would be suitable because larger stars burn brighter, but also die faster, lowering the
                chance for life to have developed. The key to creating an environment that life could flourish in is stability.</p>

                <p class="span-all-columns">Mars is a frozen, desolate planet that shows no signs of life, but has it always been that way?<br><br></p>
                <p>Recent discoveries lead scientists to believe that Mars has subsurface ice lakes under some of the major craters, and there is broad evidence of liquid water being present, on the surface, in recent history.
                    However, the temperature on Mars is generally extremely low, and it can fluctuate drastically, as the atmosphere is one-sixth of the size of Earth's. So, although the discovery of water was exciting, the conditions are still not
                    favourable for life to develop.</p>
                <p>As people's fascination with the red planet grew, many missions were sent to Mars. As a result, the immense amount of data collected tells us that Mars had favourable conditions for life a couple billion years ago.
                    It had all the common chemical elements necessary for life to flourish, and it had an energy source for all the chemical reactions life would bring - volcanic activity. On Earth, this is the sun, however, active volcanoes could
                    provide enough heat over an extended period for life to develop.</p>
                <p>The 2020 Mars Rover is scheduled to get to Mars in February 2021, and it will look for past microbial life. Although scientists have thought that they found fossilised Martian microbes in a meteor before, this
                    turned out to be incorrect. It could also be possible that, despite the promising conditions, life never did develop on Mars.</p>
